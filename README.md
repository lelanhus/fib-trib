FibTrib
=======
A N-Sequence Calculator
-----------------------

### Methods

There can be only one: `sequence`

`sequence` takes `n` and `pos`.  `n` is the order of the calculation.  Fibonacci is the 0.  Tribonacci is `n = 1` and so on.  `pos` indicates the position in the array that you want returned.

That's it.
